## Project-description

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.
The project has been converted from a static project to an interactive one.

Both [js/app.js](https://github.com/NohaElsayedJ/Landing-Page/blob/main/js/app.js) and [css/style.css](https://github.com/NohaElsayedJ/Landing-Page/blob/main/css/styles.css) were integrated to the [index.html](https://github.com/NohaElsayedJ/Landing-Page/blob/main/index.html) file to start building out the app's functionality.
Comments have been provided to the [js/app.js](https://github.com/NohaElsayedJ/Landing-Page/blob/main/js/app.js) file.

## Usage

* Converting the project from a static project to an interactive project by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
* Building a Dynamic Navigation menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page and while navigating through the page.
* The section that is active in the viewport should be distinguished from the other sections.
* Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page instead of doing the default jump.

I was confused about the Active Section part so i searched on google to get the position of the viewPort section
