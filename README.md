The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The project has been converted from a static project to an interactive one by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

Both `js/app.js` and `css/style.css` were integrated to the `index.html` file to start building out the app's functionality

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. 
section which is being viewed while scrolling through the page is declared as active bydisplaying animated circuls around it.

Comments have been provided to the `js/app.js` file.
